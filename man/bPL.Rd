\title{Individual Size Distribution for fitting a GAMLSS}
\usage{
bPL(counts, lower, upper)
}
\arguments{
\item{counts}{Number of observations for a corresponding size}

\item{lower}{Lowest size limit (does not need to equal `min(size)`)}

\item{upper}{Highest size limit (does not need to equal `max(size)`)}
}
\value{
A `gamlss2` family object
}
\description{
`bPL` returns a distribution function for ISD described as a bounded Power-Law distribution (bPL) in
Edwards et al. 2017. `bPL` is defined by only one parameter (defined as `mu` here) which is equivalent to 'b'
as described in Edwards et al. 2017. When fitting with `gamlss2`, estimate for `mu` is returned.
